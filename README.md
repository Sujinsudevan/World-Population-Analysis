# World Population Analysis Project

## Project Overview  
This project investigates global population trends using historical demographic data from the United Nations, with the goal of understanding key patterns and predicting future population growth. Using Python and machine learning, the analysis uncovers insights into demographic shifts, regional growth, and future planning considerations.

---

## Objectives

- Explore historical global population patterns from 1970 to 2022  
- Identify trends in population density, growth rates, and regional distribution  
- Engineer relevant features to capture long-term changes  
- Build a predictive model for future population estimates  
- Visualize insights for policy planning and resource allocation

---

## Tools & Techniques

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Regressor  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Label Encoding, StandardScaler  
- **Validation**: `cross_val_score`  
- **EDA**: Correlation heatmaps, population density analysis, growth trend plots

---

## Data Processing & Feature Engineering

- Removed irrelevant columns: `Rank`, `Capital`, `CCA3`, `Continent`  
- Created new features:  
  - `Population Change (1970–2022)`  
  - `Average Annual Growth Rate`  
- Applied **Label Encoding** on `Country/Territory`  
- Standardized numeric features using **StandardScaler**

---

## Key Insights

- **Asia** leads global population, followed by **Africa** and **Europe**  
- **India and China** have significantly higher populations than other countries  
- **Asia** also has the highest population density  
- **Global growth rates are declining**, especially in Asia, Europe, and South America  
- **Africa** maintains the highest growth rate, though it is gradually decreasing

## Model & Evaluation

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Regressor  
- **Train-Test Split**: 80/20  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `0.0255`  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `0.0074`  
  - **R² Score**: `0.9581`  
  - **Cross-Validation R² Score**: `0.9314`

## Conclusion

The World Population Analysis project showcases the effective use of data science to predict and understand global demographic trends. With strong model performance and consistent insights, this project provides valuable information for resource planning, policy development, and long-term infrastructure strategies.
